## Introduction

NuxtCommerce is a dynamic and lively e-commerce platform developed with Nuxt 3. Developed for WooCommerce, NuxtCommerce optimizes data flow with [WPGraphQL](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql), offering an efficient shopping experience. It stands out with its Pinterest-style user-friendly interface and fashion-oriented structure. With its dark mode feature and open-source nature, it offers flexibility and continuous development opportunities.

If your product stocks and prices are not changeable, and you are not continuously uploading new products, it could be beneficial for you to opt for [Woonuxt](https://github.com/scottyzen/woonuxt#readme). This project, developed by [scottyzen](https://github.com/scottyzen), is static, thus providing a faster solution.

## WordPress Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up your WordPress site with WooCommerce and GraphQL for seamless integration. Follow the steps below carefully to ensure a successful configuration.

### Step 1: Install Required Plugins

To begin, make sure the following plugins are installed and activated on your WordPress site:

- [**WooCommerce**](https://woocommerce.com/): The essential plugin for creating an e-commerce store.
- [**WPGraphQL**](https://www.wpgraphql.com/): Enables GraphQL support for WordPress.
- [**WPGraphQL CORS**](https://github.com/funkhaus/wp-graphql-cors): Allows Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for WPGraphQL.
- [**WPGraphQL WooCommerce (WooGraphQL)**](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql-woocommerce): Adds WooCommerce-specific GraphQL functionalities.

> **Tip:** You can install these plugins directly from the WordPress Plugin Repository or upload them manually if you have the plugin files.

### Step 2: Upload Product Data

To populate your WooCommerce store with product data, follow these steps:

1. Download the product data files from [this link](https://github.com/zackha/nuxtcommerce/raw/refs/heads/master/public/products.zip). The zip file contains both variable and variation product CSV files.
2. Navigate to the WooCommerce admin panel.
3. Go to **Products > Import**, then upload the CSV files from the downloaded zip.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to map the CSV columns to WooCommerce fields and complete the import.

> **Note:** Ensure your CSV files are properly formatted to avoid errors during the import process.

### Step 3: Configure WPGraphQL

1. Navigate to **WPGraphQL > Settings** in the WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Locate the **GraphQL Endpoint URL** and copy it. The default endpoint is typically `/graphql`.
3. Open your projectâ€™s `.env` file and add the following line:

   ```env
   GQL_HOST=<your_graphql_endpoint_url>
   ```

   Replace `<your_graphql_endpoint_url>` with the copied URL from WPGraphQL settings.

> **Important:** Make sure your server allows CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to enable communication between your WordPress backend and frontend application.

By following these steps, your WordPress site will be ready to integrate WooCommerce with GraphQL. For additional troubleshooting or advanced customization, refer to the official documentation of each plugin.
